      <h1>Peer Review Process</h1>
      
      
      
      <div class="review-section">
        <h3>PAPER SUBMISSION</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The corresponding author should submit the paper to the journal online using link <a href="https://IJFER.com/register.html" target="_blank">https://IJFER.com/register.html</a>.</li>
          <li>After submitting paper-id is sent to author.</li>
          <li>The author will be guided by email for further process and be able to track the progress of the paper by using paper id.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <div class="review-section">
        <h3>EDITORIAL BOARD</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Editorial Board will check the plagiarism, format and composition of the paper comply with the Guide for Authors, to ensure it includes the required sections and styles. If the manuscript fails to meet one or more requirements, the Editorial Board will return it to the authors for amendments.</li>
          <li>Submitted papers will be screened by the Editor-in-Chief to determine whether the manuscript abides by the focus and scope of IJFER journal. Papers that do not meet the basic requirements will be rejected without further review.</li>
          <li>If the manuscript meets all requirements, the EIC will assign it to an Reviewer with relevant expertise, who will be responsible for managing the peer review process. Reviewer may reject manuscripts that they deem highly unlikely to pass peer review.</li>
          <li>Articles submitted for possible publication are subjected to a double-blind, peer review process.</li>
          <li>Articles that are found suitable by the Editor are then sent for review to two experts in the field of the paper. Reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other.</li>
          <li>The reviewers will rate several aspects of the manuscript, offer specific suggestions for improvement, and make a recommendation with regard to its suitability for publication.</li>
          <li>The review is submitted to the journal, with a recommendation to accept or reject the paper or with a request for revision (major or minor), which should be well substantiated and justified.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <div class="review-section">
        <h3>EVALUATION PARAMETERS</h3>
        <p>The key parameters to be applied in the final evaluation of all types of submissions are:</p>
        
        <h4>Innovation</h4>
        <p>Is the manuscript original? Does it provide new evidence or ideas capable of furthering knowledge in the given social economic context?</p>
        
        <h4>Quality</h4>
        <p>Clarity, logic, English language and grammar, thoroughness, layout, etc.</p>
        
        <h4>Relevance</h4>
        <p>interest to readers, not too specific, applicability, importance of the topic, impact on social life, economy, scientific community, etc.</p>
        
        <h4>Four possible decisions may therefore be reached:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accept</strong> – the manuscript satisfies all publication parameters and is worthy of publication.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor/Major Revisions</strong> – further revision of the manuscript is required in order to satisfy all parameters.</li>
          <li><strong>Reject and Resubmission Suggested</strong> – the paper fails to satisfy key parameters and substantial revision of the manuscript is required to address its shortcomings.</li>
          <li><strong>Reject</strong> – the paper fails to satisfy key parameters and it is highly unlikely that further work can address its shortcomings.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="review-section">
